# Tile Game Maker
 Tile Game Maker is an IDE and C# framework for quick and easy development of tile-based, pseudo-8-bit games. 

**Current version:** Pre-Alpha (0.1)

Currently, the IDE only provides tools for creating and drawing tiles, tilemaps and data manipulation, including export and import to several file formats. It does not yet support the implementation of any game logic.

It also contains a managed DLL which can be referenced independently of the IDE in any other C# project targeting the .NET Framework 4.8.
